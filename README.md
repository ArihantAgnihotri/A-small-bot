# A-small-bot
I tried making a bot that had features of the dank memer bot of discord, but ONLY on C++ with command line interaction

I made is in such a way that anyone who reads the code may understand the bot
All of the code is modular so the main function just calls the "feature functions"
All the feature functions have a comment which tells about their working....

**To run the file : all you need to do is copy the code and run the cpp file **
