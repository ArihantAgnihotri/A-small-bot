# A-small-bot
I tried making a bot that had features of the dank memer bot of discord, but ONLY on C++

I made is in such a way that anyone who reads the code may understand the bot
All of the code is modular so the main function just calls the "feature functions"
All the feature functions have a comment which tells about their working....
